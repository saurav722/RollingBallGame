Steps to add movement to the ball and camera following the ball
 
â€¢	Firstly, add platforms in viewport with proper position and rotation by resetting their positionâ€”right-click on the transform under the inspector window and select reset.
â€¢	Then add a sphere in the viewport, reset the position, and place it over the platform. Name it 'Ball'.
â€¢	Now add the cube, reset its position, and place it in the starting. Name it 'Spawnpoint'. This cube will indicate from where the sphere will start and will get respawned after getting destroyed. In order to hide the mesh of the cube, go to inspector and uncheck the mesh renderer.
â€¢	Also set the view of the camera properly towards the sphere by adjusting the view, and then select main camera, go to game object, and select align with view. Now the camera angle will be properly set.
â€¢	Now add colliders to all the game objects, e.g., platforms ,sphere ,etc.
â€¢	Also add rigid body to sphere.
â€¢	Now create scripts for both camera and sphere.
â€¢	Go to the assets folder and create a new folder â€˜Scriptsâ€™. Inside this folder, create two scripts.
â€¢	Firstly, by right-clicking inside the folder, go to Create, then select a C# script. Name it â€˜BallMovementâ€™.
â€¢	Similarly, create a new script and name it 'CameraFollowâ€™.
â€¢	Now go to Chrome and put this link in the search bar.
â€¢	https://github.com/saurav722/RollingBallGame/tree/main
â€¢	In this link there are both scripts for sphere and camera. Open the script, copy it, and paste it to the  BallMovement script.
â€¢	Do similarly with the CameraFollow script.
â€¢	Now drag the BallMovement script to the sphere and similarly the CameraFollow script to the camera.
â€¢	Now select sphere and go to inspector window. Under script, you will see options for camera transform and spawn point.
â€¢	Drag the camera from the hierarchy to the camera transfer from the BallMovement script, and also drag the spawnpoint cube to the spawnpoint field.
â€¢	Select camera and go to inspector. Under script there will be target, offset and sensitivity. Go to hierarchy and drag sphere to target. Adjust the offset around x=0,y= -3,z= -6.Sensitivity=200.
â€¢	In order to add obstacles firstly add any cube or any other object .In hierarchy name it Obs.Now whenever sphere touch the objects named obs it will get back to its spawn point.
â€¢	Now play the game and enjoy the rideðŸ˜‰.
